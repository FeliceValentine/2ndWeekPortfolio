            <img src="img/coding.png" alt="graphic" width="250px"> 
            <p>As many other people working in hospitality at the time of the first lockdwon. I found myself with a lot of free time and motivation to learn a new skills. It first started as a hobby, learning about computer science and how computers are build evolved into watching Harvard cs50 introduction to coding ...and I was hooked ! As I need personal growth and software development runs in my family,I decided to give it a go. The more I was exploring and learning the more I realized how perfect fit I am for this world. Loving literature and being a creative person, I didn't realize that software engineering is something that can align with my passions and mindset but I found out that creativity and inquisitiveness is a core of successful learning. I decided that this will soon become my job - I am an apprentice now so first step is done ! A lot of learning and hard work ahead of me but I can't wait ! </p>

I actually love every single projects of my introduction to coding and I gained a lot of new skills. I love working with others as well.</p>
